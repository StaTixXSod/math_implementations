# Math implementations in Python
Hi! This repository contains implementations of some mathematical topics, that often uses in "Machine Learning" area.
All implementations are written in Python.

For now this repository contains the following topics:
- Linear algebra
- Statistics
- Probability theory
- Machine learning
